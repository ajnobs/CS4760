CS 4760 - Assignment 2
Files: master.c master.h bin_adder.c bin_adder.h Makefile README a2df.txt

Functionality: Can read and parse command line.  Allocates, attaches, deallocates, and detaches shared memory. Has a functioning timer.
Can fork and exec the accompanying program bin_adder. Makefile works as expected with the commands being:
make
make master
make child
make clean
The make will create both programs while make master will only build and compile the master program and child will only build the bin_adder program.
The make clean option works like normal but also targets .log files. Can do basic fork and exec. Structure for all functionality in place but not all
able to function properly at his time.

Known Issues:
Issues with getting the forks and exec to operate as expected.
Issues with signals and duplication.
