Files: doenv.c doenv.h Makefile README

All the tasks should function if entered properly. -h -i both function as expected. perror() used alongside
custom msg where available. Some irregularities were noticed regarding throwing error, but that seemed more
to do with parsing issues earlier in development.  Compilation should meet the requirements for the Makefile
in hoare environment. Testing on edge cases and odd formatting is a little less fleshed out than I would like.
